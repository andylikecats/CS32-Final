Mental health tracker - Build a tool that allows individuals to track their mental health and provides resources and support based on their needs. The tool could include a mood tracker, journaling prompts, and links to mental health resources.

Step 1: Decompose projects into subtasks. 

Research and identify the most effective methods for tracking mental health

Develop a mood tracker

Create a journaling prompt feature (write the prompts and put in a dictionary)

display users' mental health progress and provide personalized output based on their data

Integrate mental health resources and support into the tool, including links to articles, videos, and professional services
ï¼ˆmaybe out of scope of project) design an interface


Step 2: Identify the computational subtasks. 

A.	Mood tracker: a bit computational, collect data
B. Create a journaling prompt feature (write the prompts and put in a dictionary): This could be computational, choose the prompt according to user data instead of at random

C.	display users' mental health progress and provide personalized output based on their data: this is a computational task


Step 3: Rank the computational subtasks. 

C >A>B

Step 4: Choose one. Choose one computational subtask as your final project. Your ranking should help you choose.

We more or less decided on the Mental Health Tracker idea.
Step 5: Create a repo for your FP.
