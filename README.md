Mental health tracker - Build a tool that allows individuals to track their mental health and provides resources and support based on their needs. The tool could include a mood tracker, journaling prompts, and links to mental health resources.

Step 1: Decompose projects into subtasks. 

Research and identify the most effective methods for tracking mental health

Develop a mood tracker

Create a journaling prompt feature

split the input into separate words for text analysis

check for positive vs negative words

evaluate and print out a mood score

Step 2: Identify the computational subtasks. 

Mood tracker:

Prompt the user for input

Split the input into separate words (for later text analysis)

Define the mood score variable

Check for positive and negative mood words

Loop through each word in the input, increasing score for positive words and decreasing for negative words
       
Print out the mood score

We more or less decided on the Mental Health Tracker idea.
Step 3: Create a repo for your FP.
